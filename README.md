# Nutrition-Paradox-A-Global-View-on-Obesity-and-Malnutrition
An Obesity and Malnutrition comparison globally.

**Project Overview**
This project investigates the global nutritional paradox—the coexistence of obesity and malnutrition—across different countries, regions, genders, and age groups. Using WHO data (2012–2022), we uncover trends, disparities, and insights that can guide public health strategies and interventions.
